**Sleep**

Sleep matters. No really it does. I have had issues with sleep for years now but my recent training in Muay Thai, BJJ and Boxing added to my Kettlebell workouts have really helped.

It is a two way thing too. A recent newsletter I received from Take Action Personal Training pointed this out and ill update this post with more stats or post again with some proper references. 

Anyway, i feel rested and ready to start the day
