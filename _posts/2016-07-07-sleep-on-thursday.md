Sleep matters. No, [really it does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_sleep_deprivation_on_cognitive_performance).

I have had issues with sleep for years now but my recent training in [Muay Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muay_Thai), [BJJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu) and [Boxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing) added to my [Kettlebell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettlebell) workouts have really helped. 

It is a two-way thing too. A [recent newsletter](http://us13.campaign-archive1.com/?u=f7fe20d352e4ace31643e717b&id=d0aa68ffe0&e=2180035b6b) I received from [Take Action Personal Training](https://www.takeactionpt.net) pointed this out.

Anyway, I feel rested and ready to start the day!
