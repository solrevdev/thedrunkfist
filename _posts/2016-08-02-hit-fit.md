As well as having an hours Muay Thai training I am also doing a [HIT FIT cardio class](https://www.takeactionpt.net/hitfit.html) to boost my workouts. 

They are run by [Take Action Personal Training](https://www.takeactionpt.net) and are really good fun and an excellent workout.

I am not that impressed with my technique in this session/video as such but its more about fun and cardio after already doing special training. 

Here is a video from the [You Tube channel](https://youtu.be/U0kB35TlczI)
