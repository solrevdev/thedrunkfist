    <p>It would be fair to say that I am in the best shape physically and mentally for as long as I can remember.</p>

<p>It has not been anti depressants, juice plus shakes or anything else that has helped. I have not won the lottery and life still throws all sorts at me.</p>

<p>No, it has been improved sleep, a clean diet and lots of fun exercises that have worked magic for me.</p>

<hr />

<p>Career wise being a software developer has had its benefits and I love building and learning new technical skills, but it took its toll with the sedentary lifestyle, the insomnia and the booze to knock you out and get you to sleep.</p>

<p>These days I am a full time carer, which is not easy, but very rewarding, I am still writing code, but for the past few years I have taken up Kettlebell training which led to Boxing which led to Muay Thai which led to BJJ and MMA training and I love my new hobbies.</p>

<p>This training has also led to an improved diet and the physical exertion has also improved my sleep no end.</p>

<p>Now combine all these things and you could say I have never been happier!</p>

<p>Keep going old man! Keep going.</p>

        The drunk fist is my progress from a drunken developer into a full time carer who has stopped smoking, stopped drinking and started to take up boxing, muay thai, bjj, mma and generally just trying to be better.
